      description: [
        'Adds a source to the current `assets.json` and resolves it into the workspace-root `assets-lock.json`. Creates the manifest when needed. Adding an asset does not download its bytes.',
        'For native assets, use `org/project/asset@version`. Omit `@version` on the command line to select the latest version and save an exact pin. Numeric selectors such as `@2` and `@2.3`, and `@latest`, are also supported. `latest` means the highest numeric version, not the most recently uploaded version. The registry response supplies the hash; the asset file is not downloaded.',
        'The manifest key is a binding name. Use `--as` to choose an alias; otherwise native assets use their canonical ref as the key. The value always contains the full source, including when the key is the canonical ref. Bare version values such as `"2.3.0"` are unsupported.',
        'Every HTTP(S) source is a direct, unverified URL, even if hosted by a LoA service or containing `@version`. Adding a URL does not fetch it or use the global store. Local paths become live `file:` references relative to the declaring manifest; they are not hashed, copied, or adopted into the registry.',
        'Run this command inside the workspace whose manifest should own the binding. All workspace aliases share one runtime namespace, so duplicates across manifests are rejected.',
        'Native references use `LOA_HOST` or the configured host, defaulting to `https://api.landofassets.com`. The lockfile preserves the resolved host, so changing the environment does not redirect an existing locked asset. Native consumption uses anonymous requests.',

      description: [
        'Removes the alias from the current manifest and its lockfile importer. In a workspace, run the command inside the manifest that owns the binding; an alias from another manifest is not removed.',

      description: [
        'Resolves changed declarations and materializes the combined workspace asset set into project-local `asset_cache/`. Unchanged bindings retain their locked versions. Commit `assets.json` and `assets-lock.json`; the CLI adds generated cache and resolution-map paths to `.gitignore`.',
        'Native files are downloaded anonymously into the content-addressed global store and SHA-256 verified. Cached native bytes are checked before reuse. Project files are materialized by clone, then hardlink, then copy, depending on filesystem support. Hardlinked files share their bytes with the global store, so treat pulled native assets as immutable and use `file:` references for files you edit.',
        'Direct HTTP(S) URLs are downloaded only into this project cache without integrity checks. Existing downloads are reused; `--refresh` fetches their current response again. A failed refresh preserves an existing cached download. URL downloads never enter the global store.',
        '`file:` sources are never read, hashed, copied, or altered by pull. Offline use still requires those original files and any decoder/WASM resources used by your application to be available.',
        '`--frozen-lockfile` fails before fetching if the root lockfile is missing or differs from the manifests. It prevents resolution changes, but cannot make direct URLs or live files immutable. Use it in CI when selections must already be committed.',

        'Self-contained validation runs in the web service for both initial publication and new versions. The CLI does not inspect or package dependencies to enforce resource closure. GLB resources must be embedded. MaterialX packages must include required textures and documents safely within the archive; built-in standard node definitions do not need to be packaged. Missing, external, or escaping required resources are rejected by the service.',

        'The default `auto` mode checks each native asset and direct URL for a pulled file in project-local `asset_cache/`. Present files receive local URLs; absent files keep their remote URLs.
