# Land of Assets — public modules

This repository holds the public, open-source modules of [Land of Assets](https://landofassets.com): the TypeScript SDK, the `loa` command-line tool, and the asset runtime. Use them to manage asset selections, load assets in applications, and integrate with the Land of Assets REST API from scripts and pipelines.

The Land of Assets platform itself is closed source. These modules are developed in the open so that integrating is easy, and so you can fix or improve them yourself. **Public pull requests are welcome.**

## Asset manager

The `loa` CLI keeps asset selections in Git with `assets.json` and `assets-lock.json`. Native LoA versions have verified hashes and share a global download store; HTTP(S) URLs use a project-local cache when pulled, and `file:` references stay live. Load remotely or pull the same selections for offline use.

```sh
loa add acme/furniture/chair@2.3.0 --as chair
loa pull
```

Read the [asset manager overview](packages/website/docs/asset-manager.md) for the philosophy, source rules, workspaces, publication, and runtime integration.

## Quick start

### SDK

```sh
npm install @landofassets/sdk
```

```ts
import { createSecretTokenInstance, listAssets } from '@landofassets/sdk';

const client = createSecretTokenInstance({ secretToken: process.env.LOA_TOKEN! });
const assets = await listAssets(client, { query: { orgName: 'my-org', projectName: 'my-project' } });
```

See the [SDK README](packages/sdk/README.md) for authentication options, uploads, and the full API surface.

### CLI

```sh
npm install -g @landofassets/cli
loa auth login
loa assets list --org my-org --project my-project
```

See the [CLI README](packages/cli/README.md) for every command, or run `loa --help`.

The packages require Node.js 22.12 or newer.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm tsc
pnpm lint
pnpm test
```

The CLI talks to `https://api.landofassets.com` by default. Use `loa config set --host <url>` or the `LOA_HOST` environment variable to point it elsewhere.
